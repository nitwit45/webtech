                <p>
                    I am undertaking my AI/DS Degree at Informatics Institute Of Technology
                    I find AI extreamly interesting.
                    HTML happens to be one of my favourite programming languages.
                    <br><br>
                    Me, Chamika And Lasal came up with EUPHORIA.
                    We have used many functions in order to make the website minimal and as efficient as possible.
                    Users get a chance of exploring music at endless limits using our website.
                    Vanilla HTML CSS JS Was used when making this website
                    We were able to use Github effectively in building this project.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally I hope that your experience in using our website is a very pleasant one....
