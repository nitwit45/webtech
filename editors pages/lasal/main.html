                <p>
                    I am AI enthusiast currenly residing in Sri Lanka.
                    I am currently following my Bachelors in Artificial Inteligence and Data Science offered by Robert
                    Gordon University.
                    I love coding with Python, Java and many Web related technologies.

                    Euphoria is a Web Site envisioned by Chamika, Nithila and I.
                    We were able to encoporate what we learned at lectures, and also went above and beyond in some
                    instances.
                    It is a Web Site where users can get <em>lost in the world of music</em>.
                    The website is made with HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.
                    We were able to use Github effectively in building this project.
                    We also encoprated ARIA, to improve our acessibility.
                    <br><br>
                    I hope you enjoy our Web Site !!!
