                    I am currently enrolled in Robert Gordon University pursuing a Bachelor's undergraduate in Artificial Intelligence
                     and data science. My passion for the field of Artificial intelligence has often fuelled me to explore and educate
                      myself on the branches of Machine learning, Neural language processing, Deep Learning, Neural Networks, 
                      Cognitive Computing, and Computer Vision
