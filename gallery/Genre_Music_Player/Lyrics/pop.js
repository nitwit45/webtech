Tastes like strawberries
On a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a song
I want more berries
And that summer feelin'
It's so wonderful and warm
Breathe me in, breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without
I'm just thinking out loud
I don't know if I could ever go without
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar
Strawberries on a summer evenin'
Baby, you're the end of June
I want your belly
And that summer feelin'
Getting washed away in you
Breathe me in, breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high

I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it
Watermelon sugar high
Tastes like strawberries
On a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a song
I want your belly
And that summer feelin'
I don't know if I could ever go without
Watermelon sugar high

let whatGoes = `
Hey, girl, is he everything you wanted in a man?
You know I gave you the world (world)
You had me in the palm of your hand
So why your love went away
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you, babe (babe)
Me and you until the end
But I guess I was wrong (uh)
Don't want to think about it (uh)
Don't want to talk about it (uh)
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it (uh)
Feeling the blues about it (yeah)
I just can't do without ya
But tell me, is this fair?
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should have known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
But that's okay, baby, 'cause in time you will find
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around, yeah
Now girl, I remember everything that you claimed
You said that you were moving on now (on now)
And maybe I should do the same (maybe I should do the same)
The funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you, baby (baby)
And now it's all just a shame
And I guess I was wrong, yeah
Don't want to think about it (no)
Don't want to talk about it (huh)
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it (uh)
Feeling the blues about it (yeah)
I just can't do without ya can you tell me, is this fair?
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye? (Uh)
Should have known better when you came around
Should have known better that you were gonna make me cry
And now it's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
But that's ok, baby, 'cause in time you will find
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around, yeah
What goes around comes around (comes around, comes around)
Yeah
What goes around comes around (comes around, comes around)
You should know that
What goes around comes around (comes around, comes around)

Ah, tell me, is this fair?
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye? (Oh)
Should have known better when you came around
Should have known better that you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around ('cause I know that you're living a lie)
But that's ok, baby, 'cause in time you will find
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around, yeah (yeah babe)
Let me paint this picture for you, baby (yo, yo) (uh)
You spend your nights alone and he never comes home
And every time you call him all you get is a busy tone
I heard you found out
That he's doing to you what you did to me
Ain't that the way it goes
When you cheated, girl
My heart bleeded, girl
So it goes without saying that you left me feeling hurt
Just a classic case scenario
Tale as old as time girl, you got what you deserved
And now you want somebody to cure the lonely nights
You wish you had somebody that could come and make it right
But girl, I ain't somebody with a lot of sympathy
See, see (uh)
I thought I told ya, hey (hey)
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey (hey)
I thought I told ya, hey (hey)
(Ha, what goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey (hey)
Take it to him
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Take it to him
See (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
You should have listened to me, baby
Take it to him
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey) Take it to him
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Uh
Hey girl
Because what goes around comes back around
Ooh

Roses, I walked in the corner with the body screaming dolo
Never sold a bag but look like Pablo in a photo
This gon' make 'em feel the way like Tony killed Manolo
You already know though, you already know though
I walk in the corner with the money, on my finger
She might get it popping, I might wife her for the winter
I already know, already know, nigga roses
All I need is roses
Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast, never ask, if the life don't last
Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga raw, this who you wanna be
And I know you won't tell nobody nothing
And I know you won't tell nobody no
Roses
I might pull up flexing on these niggas like aerobics
I might tell your girl you cute but balling
That shit gorgeous
Standing on the table, Rosé, Rosé, fuck the waters
You know who the god is
Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast, never ask, the life don't last
Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga raw
Show you what I mean
I might bring them Brooklyn niggas out, oh lord it's overs
I might bring them strippers out and tell 'em do it pole-less
You already know, already know, nigga roses
Kill 'em, make it
Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast, never ask, if the life don't last
Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga raw, this who you wanna be
And I know you won't tell nobody nothing
And I know you won't tell nobody no
Roses
Roses
