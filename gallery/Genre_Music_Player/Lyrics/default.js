They say oh my god I see the way you shine
Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
Ooh I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my I, I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

They say move for me, move for me, move for me, ay, ay, ay
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again

Oh yeah
DJ Drama
I'm trapped in my mind, I need help (I need help)
I'm still going, gangster
I sit back and recline, and inhale (And inhale)
Bitch I'm back on my grind, you can't tell
(You can't tell)
When I hit the spliff, only time we face L's
Uh, okay, I stepped in this bitch like
I stepped in some shit
Right, left, right, left, left, hop, dip, skip
J.I.D, dipshit, the spliff lit, I'm lifted
I'm finna hit the zip lick for zip-lock bags
So keep your lip zipped
Shit poppin' like ten zits, I got a little weed oil
Pull it when the pen lit, that's a good drag
He be high off it in a minute, and that's a good bag
I got it from my Cali plug and she's a dentist
Back in the book bag, I roll it, light it
No look pass, that's too gassy, sulfuric acid
Girl you nasty
Now the lips of this spliff is, like
Wet as shit from your lipstick
You could just have it, but you still gotta fatty
Still managing to come up with
The magic in the true fashion
J.I.D Milly Rockin' through the madness
(Madness)
Silly cockroaches don't forget the
Glock is closer to me
So when you approach him or
Greet him do it with kosher (kosher)
We can smoke and you can watch me roll it up
Stay away from them niggas
Tryna sneak Cosby in your cup
Told you one time
I ain't gon' do molly with you, but
You so fine, I'd try and do some molly off your butt
I ain't tryna sabatoge your killer vibe, I made a joke
So I can hide what it is I really feel inside
But in your mind, I be wildin' in them high
Out of my mind
M-E-T-H
Ayy, look
Light a booger up, wedgie in the butt, yep
We pulling up
My cup runneth over, theirs ain't full enough
They bad, but that ain't good enough
They mad 'cause they
Ain't half of what I'm cookin' up
Taraji out in line
Giving cookies a plug in my supply
Need a jumper cable, why?
Gon' hook me up, the devil is a lie (lie)
Who won't shush me up, I heard he got that fire
Gon' kush me up, I'm gone
Push me up, mister how high
That I can kiss the sky
Gon' look me up
She pushing up her bra
Like cookies looking cushy in the jaw
Told her book me, hit the nookie up tomorrow
See police be tryna book me
'Cause they put me in Segal
You's a rookie
I'ma boogie 'fore you put me in the car
I got beef with my connect, I'm vexed
'Cause you see his THC is not correct
I think he should not collect
Not upset, I ain't trippin', what
He pitchin' out his best
Should be glad my hand is gripped
Around his spliff and not his neck, yes
This not a bogie, you already know the smell
Not that codeine
I heard that lean is deadly for your health
If you know me
Then know that I already got some L's
Smoke some OG, so you can smoke
That reggie by yourself
Ha, I'm trapped in my mind
I need help (I need help)
I sit back and recline, and inhale (And inhale)
Bitch I'm back on my grind
You can't tell (You can't tell)
When I hit the spliff
Only time we face L's (Face L's)
Eenie miney moe, I pick a flow and set sail
J.I.D and Joey, they say we the best out
They studying the methods
Tell them 'pass the sesh now'
I'm a walking legend walking with my chest out
Please babe don't you push me
'Cause I'm off the X, yo
My silence got 'em politicin' with
Them hedged outs
You hooked up on my findings
I'm hooked on this Kim, though
I smoke on the regular
You smokin' that Reginald
Look y'all ain't ready for this, I'm back spasmin'
Chain too heavy, it's giving me back spasm
Pardon the sarcasm, inside it's all pessim'
I rides the beat until it have a bargasm
Pregnant pause
Bitch I might shoot the club up
I'm way too raw, I'm going in without a rubber
I'm smokin' on this fire batch, it got me raisin' hell
While I hold this Mac-11 screaming "fuck twelve"
I'm trapped in my mind, I need help (I need help)
I sit back and recline, and inhale (And inhale)
Bitch I'm back on my grind
You can't tell (You can't tell)
When I hit the spliff
Only time we face L's (Face L's)
I'm trapped in my mind, I need help
I sit back and recline, and inhale
Bitch I'm back on my grind, you can't tell
When I hit the spliff, only time we face L's
Right up
That's what you call generations
And generation now
Know that, J.I.D

Uh
Yeah, yeah
When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (yeah)
Oh no, your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day she found a way out of the window to sneak out late
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day you know that we ride
Through the backstreets of a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the seat
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your whole life then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life, together in a different place
We know that love is how these ideas came to be
So baby, run away, away with me
Seventeen and we got a dream to have a family
A house and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly we turned twenty-three
Now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Have old friends and know our enemies
Now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love
He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day you know where we ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the seat
Just take my hand and come with me
Singing
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your whole life then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life, together in a different place
We know that love is how these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now
He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
